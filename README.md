The Project 1 and Project 2 pdf files outline the project requirements. The project 1 requirements involved making an HTML webpage from a given mock image of a website. The project 2 involved running an accessibility check on the project1 webpage that was created previously using Axe DevTools. The goal for project 2 was to resolve as many issues as possible while making sure that the webpage still looked identical to the mock image.
